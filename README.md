This took adam and I about 45 minuts to get from start to finish!  We had already learned a lot about multi-dim arrays by choosing those to handle our associative arrays with constraints.  we chose to build an inital multi-dim, and allow the user to imput where the change to 0 would occure.  using a simple while loop we changed all positions at the selected array to 0, and changed the selected position at all other arrays to 0.  Once we got this working, I went back and tried to refactor using different variables and  more dynamicly selected variables.  I didn't want to hard code the number of dimenstions or the number of positions in each dimension.
